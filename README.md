# Titanic Survival Prediction using Tensorflow
In this code, I want you to show how you can use the **Tensorflow** to train **Titanic Dataset**, a model that can give the prediction of surviving passengers.

# Titanic Dataset
The titanic data is divided into two parts:
1. Training data(train.csv)
2. Testing data(test.csv)

The training data should be used to build our model and testing data should be used to check how well our model performs on unseen data. The traing data uses features like gender, class, passenger
